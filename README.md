# leap-linux
Leap for the linux environment. 

This is a personal project and learning experience

This is built using Qt as the primary framework

TODO:

* Is gui really needed? leap is fully controlled via defines.ina and macros.ina files
* Perhaps remove gui and make it tray-bound only
* More gestures, tidy up existing gestures
* Move macro lock from global to individual?
