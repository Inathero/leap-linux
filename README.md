# leap-linux
Leap for the linux environment. (however support for windows has been added. Probably need to change that name)

The idea behind this program is to act as a connection between leap gestures and desktop controls

This program is slightly scriptable, where detected leap gestures (and custom gestures) can be translated to macros, mouse control, launching applications, etc.

This is a personal project and learning experience

This is built using Qt as the primary framework

TODO:

* Find that random crash bug (I think I got it!)
* Make gestures themselves scriptable instead of hardcoded (Working somewhat with leap mouse config)
